<Route path="/student/new-dashboard" element={<Navigate to="/student/student-dashboard" replace />} />
<Route path="/student/simple-dashboard" element={<Navigate to="/student/student-dashboard" replace />} />
<Route path="/dashboard" element={<Navigate to="/student/student-dashboard" replace />} />
```
