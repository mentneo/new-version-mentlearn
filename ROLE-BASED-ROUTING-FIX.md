# Role-Based Routing Fix Summary

## Problem
Admin, mentors, and creators were unable to access their respective dashboards after login. All users were being redirected to the student dashboard instead.

## Root Causes Identified

### 1. **Wildcard Route Conflict**
- **Issue**: Line 275 in `App.js` had `<Route path="/*" element={<LearnIQRoutes />} />` which was catching ALL routes including `/admin/dashboard`, `/mentor/dashboard`, and `/creator/dashboard`
- **Fix**: Removed the problematic wildcard route that was redirecting everything to student pages

### 2. **Missing Route Protection**
- **Issue**: Admin and Mentor routes had no role-based protection, allowing anyone to potentially access them
- **Fix**: Added `AdminRoute`, `MentorRoute` components with proper role checking and loading states

### 3. **Inconsistent Role Checking**
- **Issue**: CreatorRoute was checking `currentUser.role` while other parts used `userRole` from context
- **Fix**: Updated CreatorRoute to use both `userRole` (preferred) and `currentUser.role` (fallback) for consistency

## Changes Made

### 1. **App.js** (`/src/App.js`)

#### Added MentorRoute Component
```javascript
function MentorRoute({ children }) {
  const { userRole, loading } = useAuth();
  
  if (loading) {
    return <LoadingSpinner />;
  }
  
  if (userRole !== 'mentor') {
    return <Navigate to="/unauthorized" />;
  }
  
  return children;
}
```

#### Updated AdminRoute Component
- Added `loading` state check to prevent premature redirects
- Shows loading spinner while authentication state is being determined

#### Updated DataAnalystRoute Component
- Added `loading` state check
- Shows loading spinner during authentication check

#### Wrapped All Admin Routes with Protection
```javascript
// New layout routes
<Route path="/admin" element={<AdminRoute><AdminLayout /></AdminRoute>}>
  ...
</Route>

// Legacy routes
<Route path="/admin-old/dashboard" element={<AdminRoute><AdminDashboard /></AdminRoute>} />
```

#### Wrapped All Mentor Routes with Protection
```javascript
<Route path="/mentor/dashboard" element={<MentorRoute><MentorDashboard /></MentorRoute>} />
<Route path="/mentor/student/:studentId" element={<MentorRoute><StudentView /></MentorRoute>} />
// ... all other mentor routes
```

#### Removed Problematic Wildcard Route
- Deleted: `<Route path="/*" element={<LearnIQRoutes />} />`
- Kept: `<Route path="*" element={<Navigate to="/" />} />` for true 404 handling

### 2. **CreatorRoute.js** (`/src/components/CreatorRoute.js`)
- Updated to use `userRole` from context (with `currentUser.role` as fallback)
- Ensures consistency with other route protection components

## How It Works Now

### Authentication Flow
1. User logs in via `NewLoginPage.js`
2. Login function in `AuthContext.js` is called
3. `fetchUserData()` retrieves user data from Firestore (`users` or `creators` collection)
4. User role is set in both `userRole` state and `currentUser.role` property
5. Login page redirects based on role:
   - `admin` → `/admin/dashboard`
   - `creator` → `/creator/dashboard`
   - `mentor` → `/mentor/dashboard`
   - `student` → `/student/dashboard`

### Route Protection Flow
1. User tries to access a protected route (e.g., `/admin/dashboard`)
2. Route protection component checks:
   - Is user authenticated? (`currentUser` exists)
   - Is authentication still loading? (show spinner)
   - Does user have correct role? (`userRole` matches required role)
3. If checks pass: render protected content
4. If checks fail: redirect to `/unauthorized` or `/login`

## Testing Instructions

### Test Admin Access
1. Login with admin credentials
2. Should redirect to `/admin/dashboard`
3. Should see admin dashboard with all admin features
4. Try accessing `/mentor/dashboard` - should redirect to `/unauthorized`

### Test Mentor Access
1. Login with mentor credentials
2. Should redirect to `/mentor/dashboard`
3. Should see mentor dashboard with student management features
4. Try accessing `/admin/dashboard` - should redirect to `/unauthorized`

### Test Creator Access
1. Login with creator credentials
2. Should redirect to `/creator/dashboard`
3. Should see creator dashboard with course management features
4. Try accessing `/admin/dashboard` - should redirect to `/unauthorized`

### Test Student Access
1. Login with student credentials
2. Should redirect to `/student/dashboard`
3. Should see LearnIQ student dashboard
4. Try accessing `/admin/dashboard` - should redirect to `/unauthorized`

## Console Logging

The following console logs help debug role issues:

1. **AuthContext.js**:
   - `"Auth state changed, user is logged in: {uid}"`
   - `"Found user in creators collection:"` or `"Found user in users collection:"`
   - `"Setting user role to: {role}"`
   - `"User data fetched successfully, role: {role}"`

2. **CreatorRoute.js**:
   - `"Unauthorized access attempt to creator page. User details: {...}"`

3. **NewLoginPage.js**:
   - Logs role before redirect

## Database Structure Requirements

### Users Collection (`users`)
```javascript
{
  uid: string,
  email: string,
  role: 'admin' | 'mentor' | 'student' | 'data_analyst',
  name: string,
  onboardingComplete: boolean,
  // ... other fields
}
```

### Creators Collection (`creators`)
```javascript
{
  uid: string,
  email: string,
  name: string,
  // role is implicitly 'creator' if document exists
  // ... other fields
}
```

## Important Notes

1. **Creator Priority**: If a user exists in both `users` and `creators` collections, the creator role takes precedence
2. **Loading States**: All route protection components now show loading spinners to prevent premature redirects
3. **Default Role**: If no role is found, defaults to `'student'`
4. **First User**: The very first user to sign up automatically gets `'admin'` role

## Troubleshooting

### If users still redirect to student page:
1. Check browser console for role-related logs
2. Verify user document in Firestore has correct `role` field
3. Clear browser cache and localStorage
4. Check if `userRole` state is being set in AuthContext

### If "Unauthorized" appears for correct users:
1. Verify the role string matches exactly (`'admin'`, `'mentor'`, `'creator'`, `'student'`)
2. Check if user document exists in Firestore
3. Ensure `fetchUserData()` is completing before redirect

### If stuck on loading screen:
1. Check for errors in console
2. Verify Firestore connection
3. Check if `setLoading(false)` is being called in AuthContext

## Files Modified
- ✅ `/src/App.js` - Added route protection, removed wildcard route
- ✅ `/src/components/CreatorRoute.js` - Updated to use userRole consistently
- ✅ `/src/contexts/AuthContext.js` - Already had correct role-setting logic (no changes needed)
- ✅ `/src/pages/NewLoginPage.js` - Already had correct role-based redirects (no changes needed)

## Next Steps
1. Test with real user accounts of each role
2. Monitor console logs during login and navigation
3. Verify all role-specific features work correctly
4. Consider adding role-based UI elements (hide/show nav items based on role)
