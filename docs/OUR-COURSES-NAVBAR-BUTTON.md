className={`... ${
  location.pathname === item.href
    ? 'bg-blue-50 text-blue-700'

    ? 'text-gray-600 hover:bg-gradient-to-r hover:from-purple-50 hover:to-blue-50'
    : 'text-gray-600 hover:bg-gray-50'
}`}
```

```javascript
className={`... ${
  location.pathname === item.href
    ? 'text-blue-500'

    ? 'text-purple-400 group-hover:text-purple-500'
    : 'text-gray-400 group-hover:text-gray-500'
}`}
```

#### Badge Rendering:
```javascript
{item.isExternal && (
  <span className="ml-auto inline-block px-2 py-0.5 text-xs bg-gradient-to-r from-purple-100 to-blue-100 text-purple-700 rounded-full font-semibold">

## 📝 NOTES

1. **isExternal Flag**: 
   - Used to identify special navigation items
   - Triggers custom styling
   - Could be reused for other external/special links

2. **Badge Visibility**:
   - Currently always shows "NEW"
   - Consider removing after users get familiar
   - Or add user preference to dismiss

3. **Consistency**:
   - Same icon as "My Courses" (FiBookOpen)
   - Intentional: both are about courses
   - Purple color provides distinction
