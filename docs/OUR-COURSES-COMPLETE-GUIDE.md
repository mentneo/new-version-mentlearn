# Our Courses Page - Complete Implementation Guide

## 📅 Date: October 18, 2025

---

## ✅ WHAT WAS CREATED

### New Public Page: `/courses` and `/our-courses`
A beautiful, responsive page that displays **ALL courses created by creators or admins** that have `published: true` (or undefined for backward compatibility).

---

## 🎯 PURPOSE

1. **Public Course Discovery** - Anyone can view courses without logging in
2. **Marketing** - Attractive showcase to drive signups
3. **Creator/Admin Visibility** - All published courses automatically appear
4. **Search & Filter** - Easy course discovery by title, description, or category

---

## 🚀 HOW TO ACCESS

### Option 1: Direct URL
- Visit: `http://localhost:3000/courses`
- Or: `http://localhost:3000/our-courses`

### Option 2: Navigation Bar
- Click **"Our Courses"** in the top navigation
- Or: Click **"Programs"** → **"All Courses"**

### Option 3: Mobile Menu
- Open hamburger menu
- Click **"Our Courses"**

---

## 🔍 WHAT COURSES WILL SHOW

### Criteria for Display:
```javascript
// Course will show if:
course.published === true     // ✅ Explicitly published
course.published === undefined // ✅ Backward compatibility
course.published === null      // ✅ Backward compatibility

// Course will NOT show if:
course.published === false    // ❌ Explicitly hidden
```

### Who Can Create Courses:

## 🐛 TROUBLESHOOTING

### Problem: No Courses Show Up

**Solution 1: Check Database**
Run this in browser console on any page:
```javascript
(async function() {
  const { getFirestore, collection, getDocs } = await import('firebase/firestore');
  const db = getFirestore();
  const snapshot = await getDocs(collection(db, 'courses'));
  console.log(`📊 Total courses: ${snapshot.size}`);
  snapshot.forEach(doc => {
    const d = doc.data();
    console.log(`"${d.title}" - published: ${d.published}`);
  });
})();
```

**Solution 2: Check Console Logs**
- Open `/courses` page
- Open console (F12)
- Look for detailed course information
- Check if `published` field is present

**Solution 3: Verify Course in Firebase Console**
1. Go to Firebase Console
2. Open Firestore Database
3. Navigate to `courses` collection
4. Find your course document
5. Check `published` field = `true`

**Solution 4: Check Creator Dashboard**
1. Login as creator who created the course
2. Go to Creator Dashboard
3. Check "My Courses" table
4. Verify STATUS column shows "Published" (green)

### Problem: Course Shows "Draft" in Creator Dashboard

**Solution**: The course has `published: false`. It was likely created before the fix was applied. The creator can edit and re-save the course, which will set `published: true`.

### Problem: Courses Show in Creator Dashboard but Not on /courses Page

**Check**:
1. Console logs on `/courses` page
2. Verify `published` field in database
3. Check for JavaScript errors in console
4. Verify Firebase permissions allow reading
