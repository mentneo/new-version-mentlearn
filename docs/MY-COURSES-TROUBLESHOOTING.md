# üîç My Courses Page Not Showing Data - Troubleshooting Guide

## Quick Fix - Check Database & Create Sample Data

### Step 1: Visit the Course Debugger Page

I've created a special debugger page to help you diagnose and fix the issue.

**Go to**: http://localhost:5002/student/debug-courses

This page will show you:
- ‚úÖ Total courses in database
- ‚úÖ Published courses count
- ‚úÖ Your enrollments count
- ‚úÖ All courses with details
- ‚úÖ All enrollments
- ‚úÖ One-click button to create sample courses
- ‚úÖ One-click enrollment buttons

### Step 2: Check the Browser Console

With the updated StudentCourses.js file, you'll now see detailed logs:

1. Open browser console (F12 or Cmd+Option+I)
2. Go to `/student/courses` page
3. Look for these logs:

```
=== Fetching Courses ===
Current User UID: [your-uid]
Total published courses found: X
Courses: [{...}]
Enrollments with studentId: [...]
Enrollments with userId: [...]
Combined enrolled IDs: [...]
=== Results ===
Enrolled courses: X [...]
Available courses: X [...]
```

### Step 3: Common Issues & Solutions

#### Issue 1: No Courses Found (0 courses)

**Symptom**: Console shows `Total published courses found: 0`

**Solution**:
1. Go to http://localhost:5002/student/debug-courses
2. Click "Create Sample Courses" button
3. Refresh the My Courses page

**OR** - Have a creator create courses:
- Creator must set `published: true` on the course
- Check in Firestore that courses exist with published=true

#### Issue 2: Courses Exist But Not Showing

**Symptom**: Console shows courses but page is blank

**Possible causes**:
- Courses are not published (`published: false` or field missing)
- React component rendering issue
- Image loading errors

**Solution**:
1. Check console for errors
2. Verify courses in debugger page show "Published ‚úì"
3. Check browser Network tab for failed requests

#### Issue 3: Can't Enroll in Courses

**Symptom**: Courses show but clicking enroll doesn't work

**Solution**:
- Check browser console for errors
- Verify Firestore permissions allow writes to `enrollments` collection
- Use the debugger page to enroll (it shows detailed error messages)

#### Issue 4: Enrolled Courses Not Showing

**Symptom**: You know you're enrolled but courses don't show in "Enrolled" tab

**Possible causes**:
- Enrollment has `status: 'inactive'` instead of `'active'`
- Enrollment uses different field (`studentId` vs `userId`)
- Course ID in enrollment doesn't match actual course

**Solution**:
1. Go to debugger page
2. Check "All Enrollments" section
3. Verify your enrollments show "(You)" marker
4. Check if Course ID matches an actual course
5. Verify status is "active"

## How to Check Firestore Directly

### Option 1: Firebase Console
1. Go to https://console.firebase.google.com/project/mentor-app-238c6/firestore
2. Check `courses` collection:
   - Look for documents with `published: true`
   - Note the document IDs
3. Check `enrollments` collection:
   - Look for your user ID in `studentId` or `userId` fields
   - Verify `status: "active"`
   - Match `courseId` with actual course IDs

### Option 2: Browser Console
```javascript
// Check courses
const { db } = await import('/src/firebase/firebase.js');
const { collection, getDocs } = await import('firebase/firestore');

const snapshot = await getDocs(collection(db, 'courses'));
console.log('Courses:', snapshot.docs.map(d => ({id: d.id, ...d.data()})));

// Check enrollments
const enrollments = await getDocs(collection(db, 'enrollments'));
console.log('Enrollments:', enrollments.docs.map(d => ({id: d.id, ...d.data()})));
```

## Debug Logs Explanation

When you open the My Courses page now, you'll see these logs:

### 1. Initialization
```
=== Fetching Courses ===
Current User UID: R42QBOZigPPNkJ1j3svpYpmy8lJ2
```
Your user ID - needed for matching enrollments

### 2. Courses Query
```
Total published courses found: 4
Courses: [
  {id: "abc123", title: "Web Development"},
  {id: "def456", title: "Python Programming"},
  ...
]
```
All courses that have `published: true`

### 3. Enrollment Queries
```
Enrollments with studentId: ["abc123"]
Enrollments with userId: []
Combined enrolled IDs: ["abc123"]
```
Shows which courses you're enrolled in (checks both studentId and userId fields)

### 4. Final Results
```
=== Results ===
Enrolled courses: 1 ["Web Development"]
Available courses: 3 ["Python Programming", "Digital Marketing", ...]
```
Courses split into Enrolled (you're registered) and Available (you can enroll)

## Firestore Security Rules Check

Make sure your Firestore rules allow reading courses:

```javascript
// courses collection
match /courses/{courseId} {
  allow read: if true; // Anyone can read published courses
  allow write: if request.auth != null && 
               request.auth.uid == resource.data.creatorId;
}

// enrollments collection
match /enrollments/{enrollmentId} {
  allow read: if request.auth != null &&
              (request.auth.uid == resource.data.studentId ||
               request.auth.uid == resource.data.userId);
  allow write: if request.auth != null;
}
```

## Expected Console Output (Success)

When everything works, you should see:

```
=== Fetching Courses ===
Current User UID: R42QBOZigPPNkJ1j3svpYpmy8lJ2
Total published courses found: 4
Courses: (4) [{...}, {...}, {...}, {...}]
Enrollments with studentId: ["course-id-1", "course-id-2"]
Enrollments with userId: []
Combined enrolled IDs: (2) ["course-id-1", "course-id-2"]
=== Results ===
Enrolled courses: 2 (2) ["Introduction to Web Development", "Python Programming"]
Available courses: 2 (2) ["Digital Marketing", "Data Science"]
```
