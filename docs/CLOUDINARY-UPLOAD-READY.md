# ✅ Profile Photo Upload - Now Using Cloudinary!

## What Changed?

Profile photo uploads now use **Cloudinary** instead of Firebase Storage for better performance and features!

---

## ⚡ Benefits

### Why Cloudinary is Better:

✅ **No Setup Required** - Works immediately (Firebase Storage needs console setup)  
✅ **Faster Uploads** - Global CDN network  
✅ **Automatic Optimization** - Images compressed automatically  
✅ **Better Quality** - Smart compression maintains quality  
✅ **More Storage** - 25GB free (vs Firebase 5GB)  
✅ **More Bandwidth** - 25GB/month (vs Firebase 1GB/day)  
✅ **Advanced Features** - Face detection, auto-crop, filters  

### Firebase Storage as Backup:
- If Cloudinary fails → automatically tries Firebase Storage
- Ensures uploads always succeed
- Double redundancy for reliability
