## 🔧 Technical Details

### Database Queries:

**Enrolled Courses**:
```javascript
// Checks studentId field (primary)
enrollments where studentId == currentUser.uid and status == 'active'

// Checks userId field (backward compatibility)
enrollments where userId == currentUser.uid and status == 'active'

// Combines both, removes duplicates
```

**Available Courses**:
```javascript
// All published courses
courses where published == true

// Filter out enrolled courses
availableCourses = allCourses - enrolledCourses
```

**Search Filter** (Client-side):
```javascript
// Searches in:
- course.title (lowercase)
- course.description (lowercase)
- course.category (lowercase)

// Returns matching courses
```
