# 🚀 Quick Fix Applied - Profile Page Working!

## ✅ What Was Fixed

**Error**: `TypeError: doc is not a function` at LearnIQProfile.js:75

**Cause**: Variable name collision - the parameter `doc` was shadowing the Firestore `doc()` function

**Fix**: Renamed the map parameter from `doc` to `enrollmentDoc`

## ⚠️ Action Required: Cloudinary Configuration

Your profile upload will work **after** you create the Cloudinary upload preset.

### Option 1: Create Upload Preset in Cloudinary (Easiest)

1. **Go to**: [https://console.cloudinary.com/](https://console.cloudinary.com/)
2. **Navigate**: Settings → Upload → Upload Presets
3. **Click**: "Add upload preset"
4. **Configure**:
   - Preset name: `mentneo_uploads`
   - Signing mode: **Unsigned**
   - Folder: `profile-images` (optional)
5. **Save**

### Option 2: Use a Different Preset

If you already have an unsigned upload preset:

1. Create `.env` file in project root:
   ```env
   REACT_APP_CLOUDINARY_CLOUD_NAME=dp8bfdbab
   REACT_APP_CLOUDINARY_UPLOAD_PRESET=your_preset_name_here
   ```

2. Restart your dev server:
   ```bash
   npm start
   ```
