# Course Visibility Investigation - Action Plan

## 🔍 Problem Reported
**Issue**: Courses created by creators or admins are not showing up on the student page.

## ✅ What We've Verified
The code fixes from before are still in place:

1. **Creator Dashboard** (`src/pages/creator/Dashboard.js` line 755)
   ```javascript
   published: true, // Make course visible to students immediately
   status: 'active', // Course is active and available
   ```

2. **Admin Manage Courses** (`src/pages/admin/ManageCourses.js` line 135)
   ```javascript
   published: true,  // Make course visible to students immediately
   status: 'active', // Course is active and available
   ```

3. **Student Courses** (`src/pages/student/StudentCourses.js` line 56)
   ```javascript
   const shouldShow = course.published !== false;
   ```
