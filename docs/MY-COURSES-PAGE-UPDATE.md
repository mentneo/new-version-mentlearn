  courseId: "course456",
  status: "active",
  progress: 0,
  enrolledAt: timestamp,
  completedAt: timestamp     // optional
}
```

### Course Requests Collection:
```javascript
courseRequests/{requestId} {
  courseId: "course789",
  userId: "user123",
  userEmail: "student@example.com",
  userName: "Student Name",
  status: "pending",         // pending | approved | rejected
  requestedAt: timestamp
}
```

### Courses Collection:
