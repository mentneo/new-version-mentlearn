# Google Drive Assignment Submission

## Overview
Students can now submit their assignments directly to a shared Google Drive folder. This feature provides a centralized location for all assignment submissions and makes it easy for instructors to review student work.

## Implementation Details

### Google Drive Link
**Submission Folder:** https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1HSJata1zk7DVCefLGJYKaWei-CEriZd4?usp=share_link

### Location
**File:** `/src/pages/student/LearnIQAssignments.js`

## Features Added

### 1. Prominent Submission Banner
A eye-catching blue gradient banner at the top of the assignments page featuring:
- **Upload Icon** - Visual indicator with blue background
- **Clear Instructions** - Explains the submission process
- **Two Action Buttons:**
  - "Upload to Google Drive" - Opens Google Drive folder in new tab
  - "View Submissions Folder" - Secondary button to browse the folder
- **Important Notice** - File naming convention guidance
- **Responsive Design** - Adapts to mobile and desktop screens

### 2. Individual Assignment Submit Buttons
Each assignment in the list now has:
- **Submit Button** - Quick access to upload for that specific assignment
- **Conditional Display** - Only shows for pending/overdue assignments (not for submitted or graded)
- **External Link** - Opens Google Drive in new tab
- **Proper Spacing** - Doesn't interfere with "View Details" link

### 3. File Naming Convention
Students are guided to name files as:
```
YourName_AssignmentTitle_Date
```
Example: `JohnDoe_Module1Assignment_2025-10-19`

This ensures:
- Easy identification of submissions
- Organized folder structure
- Quick search and sorting
- Clear attribution

    className="inline-flex items-center px-3 py-1.5..."
