# 🎯 My Courses Page - Quick Fix Applied

## What I Did

### 1. Added Detailed Console Logging ✅
Updated `StudentCourses.js` to show exactly what's happening:
- What courses are found in database
- Which enrollments exist
- How courses are being filtered
- Final results for enrolled vs available

### 2. Created Course Debugger Page ✅
**New route**: http://localhost:5002/student/debug-courses

This page shows:
- 📊 Total courses, published courses, and your enrollments
- 📋 Complete list of all courses with details
- 📋 Complete list of all enrollments
- 🎯 Your enrollments are highlighted
- ✨ One-click "Create Sample Courses" button
- ✨ One-click "Enroll" buttons for each course

### 3. Fixed LearnIQProfile.js Error ✅
Fixed the `doc is not a function` error caused by variable naming conflict.

**Check 2**: Are courses published?
- Courses must have `published: true`
- Check in debugger - should show green "Published ✓" badge

**Check 3**: Check console logs
- Open browser console
- Look for `Total published courses found: X`

### If Enrolled Courses Don't Show:

**Check 1**: Do enrollments exist?
- Go to debugger page
- Look at "My Enrollments" stat
- If 0: Click "Enroll" on courses

**Check 2**: Is enrollment active?
- Check in debugger under "All Enrollments"
- Your enrollments should show "(You)"
- Status should be "active"

**Check 3**: Check console logs
