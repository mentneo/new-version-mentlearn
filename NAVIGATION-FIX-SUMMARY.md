# Navigation Fix Summary

## Issue Fixed
The student dashboard navigation links were not working because of a route path mismatch.

## Problem
- **Navigation Links** in `LearnIQNavbar.js` were pointing to: `/student/dashboard/*`
- **Actual Routes** in `LearnIQRoutes.js` were configured as: `/student/student-dashboard/*`

This caused 404 errors when clicking on:
- ✅ Assignments
- ✅ Calendar  
- ✅ Certificates
- ✅ Notifications
- ✅ Profile
- ✅ Progress

## Solution
Updated the navigation URLs in `src/components/student/LearnIQNavbar.js`:

```javascript
// BEFORE (Broken)
const navigation = [
  { name: 'Dashboard', href: '/student/dashboard', icon: FiHome },
  { name: 'Assignments', href: '/student/dashboard/assignments', icon: FiFileText },
  { name: 'Calendar', href: '/student/dashboard/calendar', icon: FiCalendar },
  // ... etc
];

// AFTER (Fixed)
const navigation = [
  { name: 'Dashboard', href: '/student/student-dashboard', icon: FiHome },
  { name: 'Assignments', href: '/student/student-dashboard/assignments', icon: FiFileText },
  { name: 'Calendar', href: '/student/student-dashboard/calendar', icon: FiCalendar },
  // ... etc
];
```

## Files Modified
1. `src/components/student/LearnIQNavbar.js` - Updated all navigation hrefs

## Routes Structure
The app routing structure is:
```
App.js: /student/*  
  ↳ LearnIQRoutes.js: student-dashboard
      ↳ index → LearnIQDashboard
      ↳ profile → LearnIQProfile
      ↳ assignments → LearnIQAssignments
      ↳ calendar → LearnIQCalendar
      ↳ certificates → LearnIQCertificates
      ↳ notifications → LearnIQNotifications
      ↳ progress → LearnIQProgress
      ↳ course/:courseId → LearnIQCourseView
      ↳ course/:courseId/lesson/:lessonId → LearnIQLessonView
```

Final URLs are:
- `/student/student-dashboard` - Main Dashboard
- `/student/student-dashboard/assignments` - Assignments Page
- `/student/student-dashboard/calendar` - Calendar Page
- `/student/student-dashboard/certificates` - Certificates Page
- `/student/student-dashboard/notifications` - Notifications Page
- `/student/student-dashboard/profile` - Profile Page
- `/student/student-dashboard/progress` - Progress Page

## Legacy Redirects
App.js contains redirects for backwards compatibility:
```javascript
/student/dashboard → /student/student-dashboard
/student/new-dashboard → /student/student-dashboard
/student/simple-dashboard → /student/student-dashboard
```

## Build Status
✅ Build compiles successfully
✅ No compilation errors
⚠️ Only ESLint warnings (non-blocking)

## Testing
To verify the fix:
1. Start the development server: `npm start`
2. Log in as a student
3. Click on each navigation item:
   - Dashboard
   - My Courses
   - Progress
   - Assignments
   - Calendar
   - Certificates
   - Notifications
   - Profile
4. All pages should now load correctly
