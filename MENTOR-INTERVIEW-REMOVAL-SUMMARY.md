# Mentor Interview Feature Removal - Summary

## Changes Completed ✅

### 1. Navigation Updates
**File**: `src/components/mentor/Navbar.js`

**Removed**:
- "Interviews" link from desktop navigation
- "Interviews" link from mobile navigation  
- FaBriefcase icon references

**Added**:
- "Assignments" link (FiFileText icon)
- "Calendar" link (FiCalendar icon)

**New Navigation Structure**:
```javascript
// Desktop Menu
- Dashboard (FiHome)
- Assignments (FiFileText)  // NEW
- Quizzes (FiBook)
- Calendar (FiCalendar)     // NEW
- Reports (FiBarChart2)

// Mobile Menu
- Same structure as desktop
```

### 2. Route Cleanup
**File**: `src/App.js`

**Removed Imports**:
```javascript
import InterviewPreparation from './pages/mentor/InterviewPreparation';
import Interviews from './pages/mentor/Interviews';
```

**Removed Routes**:
```javascript
<Route path="/mentor/interviews" element={<Interviews />} />
<Route path="/mentor/interviews/create" element={<InterviewPreparation />} />
```

**Kept (Student Feature)**:
```javascript
import InterviewPrep from './pages/student/InterviewPrep';
<Route path="/student/interview-prep" element={<ProtectedRoute><InterviewPrep /></ProtectedRoute>} />
```
*Note: Student interview prep is a separate feature for students to practice interviews, not related to mentor interviews*

## What This Means

### Before
Mentor had access to:
- Interview Preparation (creating interview questions)
- Interviews (managing interviews)
- Navigation cluttered with unused features

### After
Mentor now focuses on:
- ✅ **Assignments** - Create and grade student assignments
- ✅ **Quizzes** - Create quizzes and view submissions
- ✅ **Calendar** - Schedule events and sessions
- ✅ **Reports** - Track student progress
- ✅ **Dashboard** - Overview of students and metrics

## Files Modified

1. **src/components/mentor/Navbar.js**
   - Removed interview links
   - Added assignments and calendar links
   - Updated both desktop and mobile menus

2. **src/App.js**
   - Removed InterviewPreparation and Interviews imports
   - Removed /mentor/interviews routes
   - Kept student interview prep (different feature)

## Next Steps

### Immediate Priority: Student Visibility of Mentor Content

#### 1. Update Quiz Creation Modal
**File**: `src/pages/mentor/CreateQuiz.jsx`

**Add**:
- Student multi-select dropdown
- "Assign to Students" section in create form
- `assignedTo` field in Firestore document

**Implementation**:
```javascript
// Add student selector to form
const [selectedStudents, setSelectedStudents] = useState([]);
const [mentorStudents, setMentorStudents] = useState([]);

// Fetch mentor's students
useEffect(() => {
  const fetchStudents = async () => {
    const studentsQuery = query(
      collection(db, "mentorStudents"),
      where("mentorId", "==", currentUser.uid)
    );
    const snapshot = await getDocs(studentsQuery);
    setMentorStudents(snapshot.docs.map(doc => ({
      id: doc.id,
      ...doc.data()
    })));
  };
  fetchStudents();
}, []);

// In form submission
const handleCreateQuiz = async (formData) => {
  await addDoc(collection(db, "quizzes"), {
    ...formData,
    createdBy: currentUser.uid,
    assignedTo: selectedStudents,  // ADD THIS
    status: "active",
    createdAt: serverTimestamp()
  });
  
  // Send notifications
  for (const studentId of selectedStudents) {
    await addDoc(collection(db, "notifications"), {
      userId: studentId,
      type: "quiz",
      title: "New Quiz Available",
      message: `A new quiz is available: ${formData.title}`,
      read: false,
      timestamp: serverTimestamp(),
      link: "/student/quizzes"
    });
  }
};
```

#### 2. Update Assignment Creation
**File**: `src/pages/mentor/MentorAssignments.jsx`

**Status**: Already has `studentIds` in data structure ✅

**Verify**:
- [ ] Create assignment modal has student selection
- [ ] Students receive notifications
- [ ] Students see assignments in their view

#### 3. Update Calendar Event Creation
**File**: `src/pages/mentor/MentorCalendar.jsx`

**Add**:
- Visibility options (private/shared/public)
- Student multi-select for shared events
- `sharedWith` and `isPublic` fields

**Implementation**:
```javascript
// Add visibility controls to event form
<div className="space-y-4">
  <label className="flex items-center">
    <input
      type="radio"
      name="visibility"
      value="private"
      checked={visibility === "private"}
      onChange={(e) => setVisibility(e.target.value)}
    />
    <span className="ml-2">Keep Private (Only Me)</span>
  </label>
  
  <label className="flex items-center">
    <input
      type="radio"
      name="visibility"
      value="shared"
      checked={visibility === "shared"}
      onChange={(e) => setVisibility(e.target.value)}
    />
    <span className="ml-2">Share with Students</span>
  </label>
  
  {visibility === "shared" && (
    <StudentMultiSelect
      students={mentorStudents}
      selected={selectedStudents}
      onChange={setSelectedStudents}
    />
  )}
  
  <label className="flex items-center">
    <input
      type="radio"
      name="visibility"
      value="public"
      checked={visibility === "public"}
      onChange={(e) => setVisibility(e.target.value)}
    />
    <span className="ml-2">Public (All Students)</span>
  </label>
</div>

// In event creation
const handleCreateEvent = async (formData) => {
  await addDoc(collection(db, "mentorEvents"), {
    ...formData,
    mentorId: currentUser.uid,
    sharedWith: visibility === "shared" ? selectedStudents : [],
    isPublic: visibility === "public",
    createdAt: serverTimestamp()
  });
  
  // Notify selected students
  if (visibility === "shared") {
    for (const studentId of selectedStudents) {
      await addDoc(collection(db, "notifications"), {
        userId: studentId,
        type: "event",
        title: "New Calendar Event",
        message: `New event: ${formData.title}`,
        read: false,
        timestamp: serverTimestamp(),
        link: "/student/calendar"
      });
    }
  }
};
```

#### 4. Update Student Quiz View
**File**: `src/pages/student/StudentQuizzes.jsx`

**Add Query**:
```javascript
// Fetch quizzes assigned to this student
const quizzesQuery = query(
  collection(db, "quizzes"),
  where("assignedTo", "array-contains", currentUser.uid),
  where("status", "==", "active"),
  orderBy("dueDate", "asc")
);

const quizzesSnapshot = await getDocs(quizzesQuery);
const quizzes = quizzesSnapshot.docs.map(doc => ({
  id: doc.id,
  ...doc.data()
}));
```

#### 5. Update Student Calendar View
**File**: `src/pages/student/LearnIQCalendar.js`

**Add Queries**:
```javascript
// Fetch shared events (assigned to this student)
const sharedEventsQuery = query(
  collection(db, "mentorEvents"),
  where("sharedWith", "array-contains", currentUser.uid)
);

// Fetch public events (all students can see)
const publicEventsQuery = query(
  collection(db, "mentorEvents"),
  where("isPublic", "==", true)
);

// Execute both queries
const [sharedSnapshot, publicSnapshot] = await Promise.all([
  getDocs(sharedEventsQuery),
  getDocs(publicEventsQuery)
]);

// Combine events
const mentorEvents = [
  ...sharedSnapshot.docs.map(doc => ({ 
    id: doc.id, 
    ...doc.data(),
    type: 'mentor-event' 
  })),
  ...publicSnapshot.docs.map(doc => ({ 
    id: doc.id, 
    ...doc.data(),
    type: 'mentor-event' 
  }))
];

// Display with student's own events
const allEvents = [...studentEvents, ...mentorEvents];
```

## Files That Need Updates

### High Priority (Student Visibility)

## Success Criteria

### Navigation ✅
- [x] Interview links removed from mentor navigation
- [x] Assignment and calendar links added

### Content Visibility (In Progress)
- [ ] Quizzes: Mentor creates → assigns to students → students see
- [ ] Assignments: Mentor creates → assigns to students → students see
- [ ] Calendar: Mentor creates → shares with students → students see
- [ ] Notifications: Students notified when content is assigned

### Bi-directional Flow
- [ ] Mentor → Student: Content visible to assigned students
- [ ] Student → Mentor: Submissions visible to mentor
- [ ] Mentor → Student: Grades and feedback visible to student

## Summary

**What's Done**:
- ✅ Removed interview features from mentor navigation
- ✅ Added assignments and calendar to navigation
- ✅ Cleaned up unused routes
- ✅ Created comprehensive documentation

**What's Next**:
1. Update quiz creation to assign to students
2. Update calendar to share with students  
3. Verify assignment creation works properly
4. Test end-to-end visibility flow

**Goal**: When mentors create content (quizzes, assignments, events), they can assign it to specific students, and those students will see it in their respective views with proper notifications.

---

**Status**: Navigation cleanup complete ✅  
**Next Focus**: Implement student assignment functionality in quiz and calendar creation
