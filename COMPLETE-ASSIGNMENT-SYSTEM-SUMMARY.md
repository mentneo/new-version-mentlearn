### 3. Enhanced Debug Logging ✅
**Both Files Enhanced**

#### Mentor Console Logs:
```
👤 Current User: mentor-uid
📧 Email: mentor@example.com
🔍 Fetching assignments for mentor: mentor-uid
📦 Raw assignments found: 3
📝 Processing assignment: xyz123 "Week 1"
📝 Fetched assignments: 3
📊 Total assignments: 3
🔍 Filtered assignments: 3
```

#### Student Console Logs:
```
🎓 Student fetching assignments for: student-uid
📚 Found 2 assignments for student
📝 Processing assignment: Week 1 Assignment
✅ Loaded 2 assignments for student
```

#### Creation Console Logs:
```
📝 Creating assignment with data: {...}
✅ Assignment created with ID: xyz123
✅ Notifications sent to 3 students
```

### 4. Fixed Firestore Query Issues ✅

#### Problem:
- `orderBy()` with `where()` requires composite index
- Queries failed silently without index
- Assignments created but not displayed

#### Solution:

## 🎯 Key Technical Implementations

### 1. Visibility Control System

**Core Concept**: `studentIds` array
```javascript
// Assignment document
{
  mentorId: "mentor-123",
  studentIds: ["student-A", "student-B", "student-C"]
}

// Query from student side
where("studentIds", "array-contains", currentUser.uid)
// Returns ONLY assignments where student is in array
```

### 2. Notification System

**Auto-notify selected students**:
```javascript
for (const studentId of selectedStudents) {
  await addDoc(collection(db, "notifications"), {
    userId: studentId,
    type: "assignment",
    title: "New Assignment",
    message: `You have a new assignment: ${title}`,
    link: "/student/assignments",
    fromUserId: mentorId,
    assignmentId: assignmentRef.id
  });
}
```

### 3. Status Tracking

**Smart status calculation**:
```javascript
let status = 'pending';
const now = new Date();

if (hasSubmission) {
  status = 'submitted';
  if (hasGrade) {
    status = 'graded';
  }
} else if (dueDate < now) {
  status = 'overdue';
}
```

### 4. Client-Side Sorting

**No index required**:
```javascript
// Fetch without orderBy
const snapshot = await getDocs(query);

// Sort in JavaScript
const sorted = items.sort((a, b) => b.dueDate - a.dueDate);
```

## 🐛 Issues Fixed

### Issue 1: No Students Found
**Problem**: mentorStudents collection empty
**Solution**: 
- Added fallback to show all students with `role: "student"`
- Created setup script for quick data creation
- Improved empty state with instructions

### Issue 2: Assignments Created But Not Showing
**Problem**: `orderBy()` + `where()` requires composite index
**Solution**:
- Removed `orderBy()` from query
- Added JavaScript sorting
- Enhanced error logging
- Immediate functionality without index

### Issue 3: Silent Query Failures
**Problem**: No error messages when queries fail
**Solution**:
- Added comprehensive console logging
- Error details and error codes
- Step-by-step progress tracking
- Alert messages for users

## 📊 Data Architecture

### Collections Used:

1. **`assignments`** - Main assignment data
2. **`submissions`** - Student submissions
3. **`notifications`** - User notifications
4. **`mentorStudents`** - Mentor-student relationships
5. **`users`** - User profiles and roles
6. **`courses`** - Course information (optional link)

### Relationships:

```
mentor (users)
  ↓ creates
assignment (assignments)
  ↓ assigned to
students (users) [via studentIds array]
  ↓ submit
submission (submissions)
  ↓ graded by
mentor (users)
```

---

## 🔐 Security Implementation

### Firestore Rules Required:

```javascript
// Assignments
match /assignments/{id} {
  allow read: if request.auth.uid == resource.data.mentorId ||
                 request.auth.uid in resource.data.studentIds;
  allow write: if request.auth.uid == resource.data.mentorId;
}

// Submissions
match /submissions/{id} {
  allow read: if request.auth.uid == resource.data.studentId ||
                 request.auth.uid == resource.data.mentorId;
  allow create: if request.auth.uid == request.resource.data.studentId;
  allow update: if request.auth.uid == resource.data.studentId ||
                   request.auth.uid == resource.data.mentorId;
}

// Notifications
match /notifications/{id} {
  allow read: if request.auth.uid == resource.data.userId;
  allow create: if request.auth != null;
  allow update: if request.auth.uid == resource.data.userId;
}
```
