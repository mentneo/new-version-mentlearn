# Student Settings & Support Pages Fix

## Issue Fixed
Settings and Help & Support pages were not opening when clicked in the student dashboard navigation.

## Root Cause
The navigation links in `LearnIQNavbar.js` were pointing to:
- `/student/settings`
- `/student/support`

But these routes were **not defined** in `LearnIQRoutes.js`, which handles all student dashboard routes.

## Solution Applied

### 1. Added Missing Imports to LearnIQRoutes.js
✅ Added `LearnIQSettings` component import  
✅ Added `LearnIQSupport` component import

### 2. Added Missing Routes to LearnIQRoutes.js
✅ Added route: `settings` → `<LearnIQSettings />`  
✅ Added route: `support` → `<LearnIQSupport />`

### 3. Fixed Navigation Links in LearnIQNavbar.js
✅ Changed Settings link from `/student/settings` to `/student/student-dashboard/settings`  
✅ Changed Help & Support link from `/student/support` to `/student/student-dashboard/support`

## Changes Made

### File 1: `/src/LearnIQRoutes.js`

**Added Imports:**
```javascript
import LearnIQSettings from './pages/student/LearnIQSettings.js';
import LearnIQSupport from './pages/student/LearnIQSupport.js';
```

**Added Routes:**
```javascript
<Route path="settings" element={<LearnIQSettings />} />
<Route path="support" element={<LearnIQSupport />} />
```

**Full Route Structure Now:**
```
/student/student-dashboard/
  ├── (index) → Dashboard
  ├── profile → Profile
  ├── assignments → Assignments
  ├── certificates → Certificates
  ├── calendar → Calendar
  ├── progress → Progress
  ├── notifications → Notifications
  ├── settings → Settings ✅ NEW
  ├── support → Help & Support ✅ NEW
  └── course/:courseId → Course View
```

### File 2: `/src/components/student/LearnIQNavbar.js`

**Updated Bottom Navigation Links:**
```javascript
const bottomNavigation = [
  { name: 'Settings', href: '/student/student-dashboard/settings', icon: FiSettings },
  { name: 'Help & Support', href: '/student/student-dashboard/support', icon: FiHelpCircle },
];
```
