## Technical Implementation

### State Management
```javascript
// Create assignment form state
const [formData, setFormData] = useState({
  title: '',
  description: '',
  dueDate: '',
  points: 100,
  courseId: '',
  selectedStudents: []
});
const [courses, setCourses] = useState([]);
const [mentorStudents, setMentorStudents] = useState([]);
const [submitting, setSubmitting] = useState(false);
```

### Data Fetching
```javascript
// Fetches mentor's students
useEffect(() => {
  const fetchMentorStudents = async () => {
    const studentsQuery = query(
      collection(db, "mentorStudents"),
      where("mentorId", "==", currentUser.uid)
    );
    // Fetches student details from users collection
  };
  fetchMentorStudents();
}, [currentUser]);

// Fetches available courses
useEffect(() => {
  const fetchCourses = async () => {
    const coursesQuery = query(collection(db, "courses"));
    // Maps courses for dropdown
  };
  fetchCourses();
}, [currentUser]);
```

### Assignment Creation
```javascript
const handleCreateAssignment = async (e) => {
  e.preventDefault();
  
  // Validation
  if (!title || !description || !dueDate || selectedStudents.length === 0) {
    alert('Please fill in all required fields');
    return;
  }
  
  // Create assignment in Firestore
  const assignmentRef = await addDoc(collection(db, "assignments"), {
    title: formData.title,
    description: formData.description,
    dueDate: new Date(formData.dueDate),
    points: parseInt(formData.points) || 100,
    courseId: formData.courseId || null,
    mentorId: currentUser.uid,
    studentIds: formData.selectedStudents,  // WHO CAN SEE IT
    status: 'active',
    createdAt: serverTimestamp()
  });
  
  // Send notifications
  for (const studentId of formData.selectedStudents) {
    await addDoc(collection(db, "notifications"), {
      userId: studentId,              // Notification recipient
      type: "assignment",
      title: "New Assignment",
      message: `You have a new assignment: ${formData.title}`,
      read: false,
      timestamp: serverTimestamp(),
      link: "/student/assignments",   // Where to navigate
      fromUserId: currentUser.uid,    // Sender
      assignmentId: assignmentRef.id  // Reference
    });
  }
};
```

## Firestore Data Structure

### Assignment Document
```javascript
{
  // Assignment collection
  id: "auto-generated",
  title: "Week 5 Project Submission",
  description: "Complete the React project...",
  dueDate: Timestamp,
  points: 100,
  courseId: "course-id" || null,
  mentorId: "mentor-user-id",
  studentIds: ["student1-id", "student2-id"],  // VISIBILITY CONTROL
  status: "active",
  createdAt: Timestamp
}
```

### Notification Document
```javascript
{
  // notifications collection
  id: "auto-generated",
  userId: "student-id",              // WHO receives it
  type: "assignment",
  title: "New Assignment",
  message: "You have a new assignment: ...",
  read: false,
  timestamp: Timestamp,
  link: "/student/assignments",
  fromUserId: "mentor-id",           // WHO sent it
  assignmentId: "assignment-id"      // REFERENCE
}
```

### Mentor-Student Relationship
```javascript
{
  // mentorStudents collection
  id: "auto-generated",
  mentorId: "mentor-user-id",
  studentId: "student-user-id",
  createdAt: Timestamp,
  status: "active"
}
```

## UI Components

### Modal Header
```jsx
<div className="sticky top-0 bg-white border-b">
  <h2>Create New Assignment</h2>
  <p>Assign tasks to your students</p>
  <button onClick={close}>X</button>
</div>
```

### Form Sections
1. **Title Input** - Text field for assignment name
2. **Description Textarea** - Multi-line instructions
3. **Date/Points Row** - Split layout for due date and points
4. **Course Dropdown** - Optional course selection
5. **Student Selection** - Checkbox list with select all

### Student List Item
```jsx
<label className="flex items-center p-4 hover:bg-gray-50">
  <input type="checkbox" />
  <div className="ml-3">
    <p className="font-medium">{student.name}</p>
    <p className="text-xs text-gray-500">{student.email}</p>
  </div>
</label>
```

### Action Buttons
```jsx
<div className="flex justify-end gap-3">
  <button onClick={cancel}>Cancel</button>
  <button type="submit" disabled={submitting}>
    {submitting ? 'Creating...' : 'Create Assignment'}
  </button>
</div>
```

## Student Visibility

### How Students See Assignments
**File**: `src/pages/student/LearnIQAssignments.js`

```javascript
// Query assignments where student is in studentIds array
const assignmentsQuery = query(
  collection(db, "assignments"),
  where("studentIds", "array-contains", currentUser.uid),
  orderBy("dueDate", "asc")
);

const assignmentsSnapshot = await getDocs(assignmentsQuery);
const assignments = assignmentsSnapshot.docs.map(doc => ({
  id: doc.id,
  ...doc.data()
}));
```

**Key Point**: Only assignments where the student's ID is in the `studentIds` array will be visible to them.

### Notification Flow
1. Mentor creates assignment
2. Selects students (e.g., Student A, Student B)
3. Assignment created with `studentIds: ["student-a-id", "student-b-id"]`
4. Notifications created for Student A and Student B
5. Students see notification in their notification panel
6. Students click notification → redirected to assignments page
7. Students see the new assignment in their list
8. Students can submit assignment

---

## Security Considerations

### Firestore Security Rules (Recommended)
```javascript
rules_version = '2';
service cloud.firestore {
  match /databases/{database}/documents {
    
    // Assignments - Students can only see their assigned ones
    match /assignments/{assignmentId} {
      allow read: if request.auth != null && 
                     (request.auth.uid in resource.data.studentIds || 
                      request.auth.uid == resource.data.mentorId);
      
      allow create, update: if request.auth != null && 
                               request.auth.uid == request.resource.data.mentorId;
      
      allow delete: if request.auth != null && 
                       request.auth.uid == resource.data.mentorId;
    }
    
    // Notifications - Users can only read their own
    match /notifications/{notificationId} {
      allow read: if request.auth != null && 
                     request.auth.uid == resource.data.userId;
      
      allow create: if request.auth != null;
      
      allow update, delete: if request.auth != null && 
                               request.auth.uid == resource.data.userId;
    }
    
    // Mentor-Student Relationships
    match /mentorStudents/{relationshipId} {
      allow read: if request.auth != null && 
                     (request.auth.uid == resource.data.mentorId || 
                      request.auth.uid == resource.data.studentId);
      
      allow write: if request.auth != null && 
                      request.auth.uid == request.resource.data.mentorId;
    }
  }
}
```
