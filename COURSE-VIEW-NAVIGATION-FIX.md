# Course View & Navigation Fix Summary

## Date: October 17, 2025

## Issues Fixed

### 1. Logo Replacement
**Problem:** Old `/logo.png` was being used across student pages
**Solution:** Replaced with new `MenteoLogo` component that uses the updated logo from `src/assets/mentneo_logo.png`

### 2. Course Navigation Not Working
**Problem:** "Continue Learning" buttons were pointing to incorrect route paths, causing 404 errors when users tried to view course details or lessons.
**Solution:** Updated all course-related navigation links to use the correct LearnIQ route structure.

## Route Structure

The complete routing hierarchy is now:

```
/student (from App.js)
  └─ /student-dashboard (from LearnIQRoutes.js)
      ├─ / (index) → LearnIQDashboard
      ├─ /profile → LearnIQProfile
      ├─ /assignments → LearnIQAssignments
      ├─ /calendar → LearnIQCalendar
      ├─ /certificates → LearnIQCertificates
      ├─ /notifications → LearnIQNotifications
      ├─ /progress → LearnIQProgress
      ├─ /course/:courseId → LearnIQCourseView
      └─ /course/:courseId/lesson/:lessonId → LearnIQLessonView
```

### Complete URLs:
- Main Dashboard: `/student/student-dashboard`
- Course View: `/student/student-dashboard/course/{courseId}`
- Lesson View: `/student/student-dashboard/course/{courseId}/lesson/{lessonId}`
- My Courses (separate): `/student/courses`

---

## User Flow

1. **Student logs in** → Redirected to dashboard
2. **Clicks "My Courses"** in navbar → `/student/courses` (StudentCourses.js)
3. **Clicks "Continue Learning"** on a course card → `/student/student-dashboard/course/{courseId}` (LearnIQCourseView.js)
4. **Views course modules and lessons** → Can expand/collapse modules
5. **Clicks on a lesson** → `/student/student-dashboard/course/{courseId}/lesson/{lessonId}` (LearnIQLessonView.js)
6. **Can navigate** → Next lesson, Previous lesson, Back to course, or Back to dashboard

- [ ] Check Simple Navbar - new logo appears

### Navigation Verification:
- [ ] From `/student/courses` - Click "Continue Learning" on any enrolled course

## Notes

- The logo component (`MenteoLogo`) has built-in error handling with a fallback SVG
- All navigation links now use consistent path structure
- Legacy routes still have redirects for backwards compatibility (see `App.js`)
- Course view and lesson view pages are fully functional within the LearnIQ dashboard layout

## Developer Notes

If you need to add new course-related routes in the future, remember to:
1. Add the route in `LearnIQRoutes.js` under the `student-dashboard` path
2. Use the full path pattern: `/student/student-dashboard/course/...`
3. Ensure navigation links use `<Link>` or `navigate()` with correct paths
4. Test all entry points to the new route
