# Student "Our Courses" Page Fix

## Issue Fixed
The "Our Courses" page was not opening when clicked in the student dashboard navigation.

## Root Cause
The route for "Our Courses" page was **not defined** in `App.js`, even though:
- The page component existed (`StudentOurCourses.js`)
- The navigation link existed in the navbar (`/student/our-courses`)

## Solution Applied

### 1. Added Missing Import to App.js
âœ… Added `StudentOurCourses` component import

### 2. Added Missing Route to App.js
âœ… Added route: `/student/our-courses` â†’ `<StudentOurCourses />`  
âœ… Wrapped with `<ProtectedRoute>` for authentication

## Changes Made

### File: `/src/App.js`

**Added Import:**
```javascript
import StudentOurCourses from './pages/student/StudentOurCourses';
```

**Added Route:**
```javascript
<Route path="/student/our-courses" element={<ProtectedRoute><StudentOurCourses /></ProtectedRoute>} />
```

**Position:** Added right after the `/student/courses` route for logical grouping

## Full Student Route Structure

### Student Routes in App.js (Outside LearnIQ Dashboard)
```
/student/
  â”œâ”€â”€ courses â†’ My Courses (StudentCourses)
  â”œâ”€â”€ our-courses â†’ Our Courses (StudentOurCourses) âœ… NEW
  â”œâ”€â”€ enroll/:courseId â†’ Course Enrollment
  â”œâ”€â”€ interview-prep â†’ Interview Preparation
  â”œâ”€â”€ refer-and-earn â†’ Referral Program
  â”œâ”€â”€ quiz/:quizId â†’ Quiz Attempt
  â”œâ”€â”€ quizzes â†’ All Quizzes
  â””â”€â”€ quizzes/:quizId/take/:assignmentId â†’ Take Quiz
```

### Student Routes in LearnIQ Dashboard Layout
```
/student/student-dashboard/
  â”œâ”€â”€ (index) â†’ Dashboard
  â”œâ”€â”€ profile â†’ Profile
  â”œâ”€â”€ assignments â†’ Assignments
  â”œâ”€â”€ certificates â†’ Certificates
  â”œâ”€â”€ calendar â†’ Calendar

  â”œâ”€â”€ settings â†’ Settings
  â”œâ”€â”€ support â†’ Help & Support
  â””â”€â”€ course/:courseId â†’ Course View
```

## Navigation Link

**In LearnIQNavbar.js:**
```javascript
{ name: 'Our Courses', href: '/student/our-courses', icon: FiBookOpen }
```

This link now correctly routes to the StudentOurCourses page.

## Component Details

**File:** `/src/pages/student/StudentOurCourses.js`

**Purpose:**
- Display all available courses (course catalog/marketplace)
- Show courses that students can browse and enroll in
- Different from "My Courses" which shows only enrolled courses

**Features:**
- Course search and filtering
- Course categories
- Course cards with details
- Enrollment buttons
- Responsive layout (on todo list for mobile optimization)

## Difference Between Pages

### My Courses (`/student/courses`)
- Shows courses the student is **enrolled in**
- Personal dashboard view
- Shows progress and status
- Component: `StudentCourses.js`

### Our Courses (`/student/our-courses`)
- Shows **all available courses** (catalog)
- Course discovery and browsing
- Shows enrollment options
- Component: `StudentOurCourses.js`
