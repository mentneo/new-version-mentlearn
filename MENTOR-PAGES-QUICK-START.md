  title: "New Submission",
  message: "John Doe submitted Assignment 1",
  type: "submission",
  read: false,
  timestamp: Timestamp,
  actionUrl: "/mentor/assignments/123"
}
```

#### `mentorEvents`
```javascript
{
  mentorId: "mentor-uid",
  title: "Student Meeting",
  description: "Discuss progress",
  date: Timestamp,
  startTime: "10:00",
  endTime: "11:00",
  type: "meeting",
  color: "#4F46E5",
  reminder: "15"
}
```

#### `assignments` (ensure these fields exist)
```javascript
{
  mentorId: "mentor-uid",
  title: "Assignment Title",
  description: "Assignment description",
  dueDate: Timestamp,
  studentIds: ["student1", "student2"]
}
```
